"""Who the player is. Two ways, and the deployment picks.

**CookieIdentity is the default.** You claim a display name, the server hands back
an opaque token, and that token is who you are until it expires. No password, no
account: the right amount of security for a game of tic tac toe and no more. It
stops a player impersonating another *player*, and protects nothing else. The
cookie is the only credential, so it is unguessable, HttpOnly so page scripts
cannot read it, and SameSite=Lax so another origin cannot ride along on it.

In this mode a request header is worth NOTHING. Whoever is talking to us can set
any header they like, so treating one as proof of identity would let anybody be
anybody. There is a test that fails if that is reintroduced.

**ProxyIdentity is opt-in, and trusts exactly two headers.** It exists for a
deployment where the process is unreachable except through an authenticating
proxy -- ours sits behind Envoy, which terminates an OIDC flow, with a network
policy that makes Envoy the only client that can open a socket to us. There, and
only there, the header is not client-supplied and is worth exactly as much as the
proxy's own authentication.

The code cannot check that precondition. The flag is an operator's assertion, and
if it is wrong the server is handed to anyone who can send a header.
